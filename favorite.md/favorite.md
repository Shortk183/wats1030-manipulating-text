I really like the Nano text editor best mainly due to ease. Emacs and Vi are great also in their own ways. I need to practice more and get used their different shortcuts.
I do think that once I can get used to EMACS a little more that it will take the most used spot for me and that Nano could be a beginers choice. 
Once a locked myself into a room with dual laptops, one for command line and the other to look up cheat sheets that seemed to make a huge change in my navigation skills.
